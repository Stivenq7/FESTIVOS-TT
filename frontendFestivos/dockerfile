# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
# Use a Node.js image to compile the project
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the project code
COPY . .

# Compile the application for production
RUN npm run build -- --output-path /usr/share/nginx/html --configuration production

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
# Use a lightweight Nginx image to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the static files from the 'build' stage to the Nginx directory
COPY --from=build /usr/share/nginx/html /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the standard HTTP port
EXPOSE 80

# Nginx's default command already serves the files, so no custom CMD is needed
